## Issues, Bugs, Questions, Enhancement Requests

Feel free to Report bugs, questions or enhancement requests as issues.

## Pull Requests

To make a pull request fork this project into your own GitHub repository and after making changes create a PR.  Read https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/

Please test your changes locally to make sure you didn't break anything.

If you are making multiple unrelated changes submit multiple PRs so they can be evaluated and merged in individually (if unrelated changes are trivial then one PR is fine).
