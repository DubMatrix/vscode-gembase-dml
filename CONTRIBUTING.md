## Pull Requests

To make a pull request fork this project into your own GitHub repository and after making changes create a PR.  Read https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/

Please test your changes locally to make sure you didn't break anything.

If you are making multiple unrelated changes please submit multiple PRs so they can be discussed and merged in individually (if changes are trivial or if they are dependent on each other than one PR is fine).
