# Gembase DML Editor Extension for Visual Studio Code

This extension provides Syntax highlighting and Snippets for Gembase DML (Data Manipulation Language).

This extension is in alpha, standard precautions apply (use this extension in a test environment before using it in production, make sure you have backups and version control on your code, etc.)

# Features
Syntax highligting and auto-complete using snippets for most DML code blocks, forms, expressions, statements, and functions.  Use the tab key to auto-complete or jump between tab-stops.

Note: Syntax colorization should work on most themes.  It was tested againt the default Visual Studio Code light and dark themes: Dark+ (default dark) and Light+ (Default Light.  Some color themes like "Dark (Visual Studio) and "Light (Visaul Studio)" don't include colorizing for things like variables.  This is intended behavior as it's a design decision by the theme author to leave out colorization for such.
