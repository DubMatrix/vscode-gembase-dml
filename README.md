# Gembase DML Editor Extension for Visual Studio Code

This extension provides Syntax highlighting and Snippets for Gembase DML (Data Manipulation Language).

# Features
Syntax highligting and auto-complete using snippets for most DML code blocks, forms, expressions, statements, and functions.  Use the tab key to auto-complete or jump between tab-stops.

Note: Syntax colorization should work on most themes.  It was tested againt the default Visual Studio Code light and dark themes: Dark+ (default dark) and Light+ (Default Light.  Some color themes like "Dark (Visual Studio) and "Light (Visaul Studio)" don't include colorizing for things like variables.  This is intended behavior as it's a design decision by the theme author to leave out colorization for such.

# Warning
This extension is in alpha.  It may generate bad code that doesn't compile.  Standard precautions apply (use this extension in a test environment before using it in production, make sure you have backups and version control on your code, etc.)
